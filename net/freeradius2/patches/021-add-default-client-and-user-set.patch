-#	This file contains authentication security and configuration
-#	information for each user.  Accounting requests are NOT processed
-#	through this file.  Instead, see 'acct_users', in this directory.
-#
-#	The first field is the user's name and can be up to
-#	253 characters in length.  This is followed (on the same line) with
-#	the list of authentication requirements for that user.  This can
-#	include password, comm server name, comm server port number, protocol
-#	type (perhaps set by the "hints" file), and huntgroup name (set by
-#	the "huntgroups" file).
-#
-#	If you are not sure why a particular reply is being sent by the
-#	server, then run the server in debugging mode (radiusd -X), and
-#	you will see which entries in this file are matched.
-#
-#	When an authentication request is received from the comm server,
-#	these values are tested. Only the first match is used unless the
-#	"Fall-Through" variable is set to "Yes".
-#
-#	A special user named "DEFAULT" matches on all usernames.
-#	You can have several DEFAULT entries. All entries are processed
-#	in the order they appear in this file. The first entry that
-#	matches the login-request will stop processing unless you use
-#	the Fall-Through variable.
-#
-#	If you use the database support to turn this file into a .db or .dbm
-#	file, the DEFAULT entries _have_ to be at the end of this file and
-#	you can't have multiple entries for one username.
-#
-#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
-#	line indicate the configuration values to be passed back to
-#	the comm server to allow the initiation of a user session.
-#	This can include things like the PPP configuration values
-#	or the host to log the user onto.

-#
-#  Defines a RADIUS client.
-#
-#  '127.0.0.1' is another name for 'localhost'.  It is enabled by default,
-#  to allow testing of the server after an initial installation.  If you
-#  are not going to be permitting RADIUS queries from localhost, we suggest
-#  that you delete, or comment out, this entry.
-#
-#
-
-#
-#  Each client has a "short name" that is used to distinguish it from
-#  other clients.
-#
-#  In version 1.x, the string after the word "client" was the IP
-#  address of the client.  In 2.0, the IP address is configured via
-#  the "ipaddr" or "ipv6addr" fields.  For compatibility, the 1.x
-#  format is still accepted.
-#
 client localhost {
-	#  Allowed values are:
-	#	dotted quad (1.2.3.4)
-	#       hostname    (radius.example.com)
 	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
-
-	#  OR, you can use an IPv6 address, but not both
-	#  at the same time.
-#	ipv6addr = ::	# any.  ::1 == localhost
-
-	#
-	#  A note on DNS:  We STRONGLY recommend using IP addresses
-	#  rather than host names.  Using host names means that the
-	#  server will do DNS lookups when it starts, making it
-	#  dependent on DNS.  i.e. If anything goes wrong with DNS,
-	#  the server won't start!
-	#
-	#  The server also looks up the IP address from DNS once, and
-	#  only once, when it starts.  If the DNS record is later
-	#  updated, the server WILL NOT see that update.
-	#
-
-	#  One client definition can be applied to an entire network.
-	#  e.g. 127/8 should be defined with "ipaddr = 127.0.0.0" and
-	#  "netmask = 8"
-	#
-	#  If not specified, the default netmask is 32 (i.e. /32)
-	#
-	#  We do NOT recommend using anything other than 32.  There
-	#  are usually other, better ways to achieve the same goal.
-	#  Using netmasks of other than 32 can cause security issues.
-	#
-	#  You can specify overlapping networks (127/8 and 127.0/16)
-	#  In that case, the smallest possible network will be used
-	#  as the "best match" for the client.
-	#
-	#  Clients can also be defined dynamically at run time, based
-	#  on any criteria.  e.g. SQL lookups, keying off of NAS-Identifier,
-	#  etc.
-	#  See raddb/sites-available/dynamic-clients for details.

-	#  default, otherwise it's not a secret any more!
-	#
-	#  The secret can be any string, up to 8k characters in length.
-	#
-	#  Control codes can be entered vi octal encoding,
-	#	e.g. "\101\102" == "AB"
-	#  Quotation marks can be entered by escaping them,
-	#	e.g. "foo\"bar"
-	#
-	#  A note on security:  The security of the RADIUS protocol
-	#  depends COMPLETELY on this secret!  We recommend using a
-	#  shared secret that is composed of:
-	#
-	#	upper case letters
-	#	lower case letters
-	#	numbers
-	#
-	#  And is at LEAST 8 characters long, preferably 16 characters in
-	#  length.  The secret MUST be random, and should not be words,
